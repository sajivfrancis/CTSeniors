# CT-Seniors
Making life easier for seniors in Connecticut

We are in the process of making Connecticut a more hospitable place for all seniors living in the state. We would like to provide an easy-to-use web interface for Seniors to search, find results, get directions and much more. This website is still in development stage and we would be more than glad to get your feedback
